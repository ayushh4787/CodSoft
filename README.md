Hello!

I’m Ayush Sharma, a first-year B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence at BBD, Lucknow. I’m excited to share the code for the tasks I completed during my internship at Codsoft.

I’ve submitted the following programs:

Password Generator

Rock Paper Scissors Game

Arithmetic Calculator

All of these projects were developed using Python, which aligns with the focus of my internship.

Thank you!
